1️⃣ Caesar Cipher
Created by: Julius Caesar

Approximate date: 58–50 BCE

Place: Ancient Rome

Purpose: Secure military and political messages against unauthorized reading.

How it works:
A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
Example (shift by 3):
A → D, B → E, C → F, ..., X → A, Y → B, Z → C

Usage:
Julius Caesar used this cipher to communicate confidentially with generals and allies during military campaigns.

Modern relevance:
Although easily breakable today, it’s used for educational purposes and simple puzzles. Some online games and beginner-level cryptography classes still introduce students to this cipher.

2️⃣ Vigenère Cipher
Created by: Attributed to Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553 (often mistakenly credited to Blaise de Vigenère)

Approximate date: 16th century

Place: Renaissance Italy & France

Purpose: Improve upon simple monoalphabetic ciphers like Caesar by introducing polyalphabetic substitution.

How it works:
Uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext. Each letter of the keyword determines the Caesar shift for the corresponding letter in the message.
Example:
Plaintext: HELLO
Key: KEYKE
Result: RIJVS

Usage:
Used in diplomatic and military correspondence for centuries as one of the most secure ciphers before modern computing.

Modern relevance:
Broken in the 19th century by Charles Babbage and Friedrich Kasiski. Now primarily educational.

3️⃣ Trithemius Cipher
Created by: Johannes Trithemius

Approximate date: 1508 (published posthumously in 1518)

Place: Germany

Purpose: Conceal written messages through a progressive shift cipher.

How it works:
Similar to Caesar, but instead of a constant shift, it increments the shift by one for each letter.
Example (starting with shift = 1):
A → B, B → D, C → F, D → G, E → I, etc.

Usage:
Outlined in Trithemius's book Polygraphia, one of the first printed works on cryptography. Used by scholars and secret societies.

Modern relevance:
Of mainly historical interest as a precursor to polyalphabetic ciphers like Vigenère.

4️⃣ Atbash Cipher
Created by: Ancient Hebrew scribes

Approximate date: Around 600 BCE

Place: Ancient Israel

Purpose: Encode sacred texts or secret messages.

How it works:
A monoalphabetic substitution cipher where the alphabet is reversed.
Example:
A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, C ↔ X, etc.
Plaintext: HELLO
Ciphertext: SVOOL

Usage:
Found in biblical texts, such as the Book of Jeremiah, where names or places were encoded.

Modern relevance:
An academic cipher used in historical cryptography studies and puzzle games.

5️⃣ Daniel Defoe Cipher (Even/Odd Position Steganography)
Created by: Referenced in cryptographic practices inspired by Daniel Defoe’s writings and early 18th-century espionage.

Approximate date: 1720s

Place: England

Purpose: Hide a secret message by placing its letters at either even or odd positions in a string, while filling the remaining positions with random filler characters.

How it works:
The sender and receiver agree in advance whether the message letters will be placed in even or odd positions within a string. The positions not used for message letters are filled with randomly chosen characters, making the overall message appear meaningless to unintended readers.

Example (message in even positions):

Secret message: HELLO

Generated ciphertext (with message in even positions):
A H Q E Z L R L X O
Positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 → H, E, L, L, O
Other positions: random filler letters.

Example (message in odd positions):
H A E Q L Z L R O X
Positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 → H, E, L, L, O

Usage:
Used historically for covert communication, where secrecy relied on knowing which positions contained the actual message. Anyone intercepting the message would see a random string unless aware of the even/odd rule.

Modern relevance:
Rarely used in practical cryptography today, but often cited as a classic example of manual steganography techniques in cryptography history.
